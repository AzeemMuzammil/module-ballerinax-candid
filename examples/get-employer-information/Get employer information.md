# Get Employer Information

This example outlines the process of retrieving detailed employer information for a specific nonprofit organization using the Candid.org Premier API. It focuses on extracting comprehensive data, including advanced financial analysis, leadership information, and in-depth program descriptions. By making an API call to the Premier API with an organization's EIN (Employer Identification Number), developers can access a wealth of information that can be used for in-depth analysis, reporting, or enhancing the data quality of nonprofit databases.
